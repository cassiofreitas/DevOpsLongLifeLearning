# bcb_api
APIs learning path

This is the first work with Python and JSON APIs.

‚ö†Ô∏è there is a version in bash script, to help me to study; and to have fun. üòÖ

My plan is:
- learn the primitives, to serialize/deserialize JSON.
- Produce a first version, where I will have BCB, BINANCE, COINGECKO and ETHSCAN APIs consuming.
- Once I have the backend working, I will develop some WEB frontend, to show me the values.

Motivation:
- My mindset is to automate repetitive tasks; nowadays, I am getting those informations mannualy.
- Learn by example; learn by doing.
- Improve my programming skills.
