## The two axes of flexbox
>
> When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes â€” the main axis and the cross axis.
> The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.
> **Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes,** so it is worth understanding how they work from
> the outset.
